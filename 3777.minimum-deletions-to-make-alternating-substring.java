You are solving a LeetCode coding problem. Follow this structured approach:

Step 1 - Extract Problem Specifics: State the exact input format, output format, and constraints from the problem. Identify what makes this particular problem challenging.

Step 2 - Design Your Approach: Select ONE algorithmic approach. Explain the key insight that solves this specific problem and why it guarantees correctness.

Step 3 - Identify Edge Cases: List specific edge cases based on the given constraints. For each edge case, explain how your approach handles it correctly.

Step 4 - Outline Your Algorithm: Describe your solution step-by-step. For each major component, explain what it does and why it works.

Step 5 - Trace Through Example: Take a concrete example from the problem. Manually trace your algorithm step-by-step, writing down actual intermediate values at each point. Verify the final output matches the expected result. If it doesn't match, identify exactly where the logic fails.

Step 6 - Analyze Complexity: Determine time and space complexity with brief justification.

Step 7 - Implement Complete Solution: Write your full, runnable solution code in the specified language. Match the provided template format exactly.

OUTPUT: After completing your analysis, output a JSON object with exactly two fields:
- "reasoning": Your complete step-by-step analysis from steps 1-6 with problem-specific details
- "result": Your complete working code from step 7 in the specified programming language
