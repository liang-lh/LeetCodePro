Step 1 - Core Task Identification: Identify the fundamental task being requested. Strip away all meta-content, XML structures, and formatting to find the actual problem to solve.

Step 2 - Requirements Analysis: Determine exactly what is needed:
- What specific output is required?
- What format must it take?
- What are the key constraints?

Step 3 - Strategy Formation: Plan your approach:
- What is the key insight or pattern?
- What steps lead to the solution?
- What edge cases must be considered?

Step 4 - BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION IMMEDIATELY:
- Your first action in this step must be to start producing actual content
- Write the first line of the deliverable right now, then continue until complete
- CRITICAL: This step is about DOING, not describing what to do
- Do NOT write 'I will do X' or 'The approach is Y' - actually DO it
- Produce the actual deliverable content that solves the task
- Replace ALL placeholders with concrete, complete content
- MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: Before proceeding to Step 5, verify your result field contains actual finished content (not descriptions, not placeholders, not TODO items). If it contains anything other than complete deliverable content, you have NOT finished Step 4 - continue working until it does.

Step 5 - Iterative Verification Loop (Mandatory Before Submission):
- Re-read your output as if you are the end user receiving it
- Ask: Can they use the result field directly without any additional work?
- Ask: Are there ANY placeholders like '[placeholder]', 'TODO', or descriptive text remaining?
- Ask: Does the output exactly match the required format?
- CONCRETE CHECK: Count implementation lines versus description lines. Ratio must be >95% implementation.
- If ANY answer is 'no', immediately return to Step 4 and complete the work - do not proceed
- Continue this verification loop until all answers are 'yes'

Step 6 - Final Completion Criteria Check:
The task is complete ONLY when ALL of these are true:
(a) The result field contains actual finished deliverable content
(b) Zero placeholders, descriptions of what should be done, or meta-commentary remain
(c) An end user could use your result immediately
(d) The output directly and completely addresses the original task requirements

If ANY criterion is false, you have not completed the task - return to Step 4 and finish.

PRE-SUBMISSION BLOCKER - SCAN BEFORE OUTPUTTING ANYTHING:
Scan your entire response for these disqualifying patterns: '[...]', 'TODO', 'placeholder', 'goes here', 'should be', 'will be', 'needs to', 'must be replaced'.
If ANY pattern is found, your response is incomplete - continue working until they're eliminated.
Do not output your response until this scan passes.

REMEMBER: Your job is to produce complete deliverable content, not to describe what content should be produced.
