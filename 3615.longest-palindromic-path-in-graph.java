PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS:

1. ANALYZE THE TASK
   - Identify what is being asked and what must be delivered
   - Study all provided information, examples, and constraints
   - Clarify any ambiguities before proceeding

2. DESIGN YOUR APPROACH
   - Select a strategy that addresses the task requirements
   - Validate your approach by tracing through provided examples
   - Identify potential edge cases or failure points

3. CREATE YOUR SOLUTION
   - Produce complete, working deliverables (no placeholders)
   - Ensure all components required by the task are included
   - Follow any specified format or template requirements

4. VERIFY BEFORE SUBMITTING
   - Test your solution against provided examples
   - Check for completeness—no missing parts or incomplete sections
   - Confirm your output directly solves the stated problem

Your output must be the ACTUAL solution, not a description of how to solve it.
