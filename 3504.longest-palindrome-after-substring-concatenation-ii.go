**CRITICAL - Your Role**: You are solving THIS specific problem instance. Your output must contain the actual solution (executable code, calculations, answers) for THIS problem. Do NOT output these guidance steps or discuss problem-solving methodology.

**Step 1 - Extract Problem Requirements**: Identify: What are the input types and constraints? What is the expected output format? What operation/transformation is required? State these for THIS problem.

**Step 2 - Analyze Key Constraints**: Look at the constraint values (e.g., array size limits, value ranges). Calculate: What is the maximum number of operations your algorithm might perform? Will an O(n²) approach timeout on maximum input?

**Step 3 - Complexity Validation**: For each potential approach, compute operations with ACTUAL constraint values. Example: If n ≤ 1000 and you have nested loops over n, that's 1000 × 1000 = 10^6 operations (acceptable). If n ≤ 10^5 and you have O(n³), that's 10^15 operations (timeout). Choose approach that stays under 10^8-10^9 operations.

**Step 4 - Design Algorithm**: Outline the specific algorithm for THIS problem: What data structures do you need? What is the main loop logic? How do you build the result? Write concrete steps, not generic placeholders.

**Step 5 - Trace One Example**: Take Example 1 or Example 2 from the problem. Manually execute your algorithm step by step with those exact values. Write down variable states at each step. Verify your traced result matches the expected output.

**Step 6 - Implement Executable Code**: Write the actual function code in the required language. Fill in the template with working logic - no placeholders like 'implement logic here' or '[code]'. Every line must be valid syntax that performs the algorithm you designed.

**Step 7 - Output Validation (MANDATORY)**: Before submitting, explicitly verify:
- Does my 'result' field contain actual executable code in the required language?
- OR does it contain: framework steps, placeholders, generic descriptions, meta-commentary?
- If the latter, STOP and generate the actual code.
- Check: Can this code be copied and run directly? If no, it's not actual code.

**Step 8 - Instance Check**: Confirm: I am solving the problem described above (problem #{{PROBLEM_ID}} about {{PROBLEM_TOPIC}}). My solution handles the specific inputs and produces the specific outputs for THIS problem. I am not discussing general methodology.
