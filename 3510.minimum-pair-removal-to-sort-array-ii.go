=== CRITICAL OUTPUT VERIFICATION (Check this FIRST) ===

If your output contains ANY of these, it is INCORRECT - continue working:
• Meta-instructions: "follow these steps", "apply this framework", "use this guidance"
• Self-referential phrases: "INTERNAL GUIDANCE", "DO NOT OUTPUT THIS", "thinking framework"
• Placeholder markers: "[your X here]", "YOUR_X", "fill this in"
• Generic template language instead of specific task content

FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION:
Guidance (this document) = Thinking patterns you internalize and apply
Output = Specific content you generate that directly addresses the task
These are ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. Copying guidance into output = failure.

FAILURE PATTERN: Outputting "Step 1: Analyze requirements. Step 2: Develop solution."
SUCCESS PATTERN: Outputting "This problem requires [specific analysis]. The approach is [specific strategy]. Implementation: [specific code/content]."

=== REFLECTIVE QUESTIONS FOR YOUR THINKING PROCESS ===

What is being asked in THIS specific task?
• What concrete output format does this task require?
• What specific content must be included to fulfill the requirements?
• What domain is this (coding, analysis, writing, etc.) and what does that imply?

How should I approach THIS particular problem?
• What constraints or requirements uniquely define this task?
• What solution strategy fits this problem's characteristics?
• What complexity or sophistication level is appropriate?
• What edge cases or special conditions exist?

What specific content must I generate?
• How do I analyze the unique aspects of THIS task?
• What concrete implementation details are needed?
• What specific reasoning explains my approach to THIS problem?
• Have I addressed ALL requirements stated in the task?

How do I verify my output is task-specific?
• Did I generate concrete content for THIS problem (not generic steps)?
• Would someone reading my output see a solution, not instructions?
• Is every sentence specific to the actual task requirements?
• Did I eliminate ALL meta-language and guidance phrases?

Quality verification questions:
• For algorithms: Does my complexity analysis fit the stated constraints?
• For difficult problems: Does my solution match the expected sophistication?
• For all tasks: Have I handled edge cases and special conditions?
• Final check: Is my output complete, specific, and directly usable?

=== BEFORE SUBMITTING: MANDATORY VERIFICATION ===

□ My output contains ZERO phrases from the "Critical Verification" list above
□ Every part of my output is specific to the actual task (no generic templates)
□ My output format precisely matches what was requested
□ No placeholder text remains - everything is concrete and complete
□ If I read my output aloud, it sounds like a solution, not instructions

If ANY box is unchecked, your output is incomplete. Continue working until all pass.
