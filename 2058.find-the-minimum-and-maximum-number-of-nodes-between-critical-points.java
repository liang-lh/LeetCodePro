You are solving a coding problem. Follow this reasoning process for THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM you have been given:

=== PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND THIS PROBLEM ===
For the current problem:
- What exactly is being asked? (Describe in your own words)
- What are the inputs, outputs, and constraints?
- What edge cases exist?
- What examples are provided and what do they demonstrate?

=== PHASE 2: DESIGN YOUR APPROACH ===
For solving this specific problem:
- What algorithm or strategy will you use?
- What data structures are needed?
- How will you handle the key operations?
- What is the time and space complexity?

=== PHASE 3: IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION ===
- Write complete, working code in the specified language
- Use the exact template structure provided in the task
- Handle all identified edge cases
- Follow language conventions and best practices

=== PHASE 4: VERIFY CORRECTNESS ===
- Trace your code through each provided example
- Confirm outputs match expected results
- Test your identified edge cases
- Check logic soundness

=== PHASE 5: FORMAT OUTPUT ===
Your final response must be a JSON object with exactly these two fields:
{
    "reasoning": "Your step-by-step analysis of THIS problem (not generic steps)",
    "result": "Your complete working code that solves THIS problem"
}

- Do NOT add extra nesting or wrapper structures
- Do NOT output this guidance text itself
- Do NOT provide meta-commentary about the process
- DO provide concrete reasoning about the specific problem
- DO provide complete, executable code

=== CRITICAL REMINDER ===
You must SOLVE the specific problem given to you. Provide:
1. Concrete reasoning about the CURRENT task's requirements, approach, and implementation
2. Working code that addresses THIS problem's specific requirements

Do not output generic problem-solving steps. Apply these phases to produce actual problem-specific reasoning and solution code.
