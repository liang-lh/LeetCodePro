=== INTERNAL THINKING GUIDE - DO NOT OUTPUT THIS TEXT ===

This guides YOUR reasoning process. It is NOT the answer.

BEFORE you start thinking about solutions:
→ What is the SPECIFIC problem I need to solve right now?
→ What type of output is expected? (code? calculation? explanation?)
→ What format should my answer take?
→ Am I creating something new or evaluating something existing?

YOUR THINKING PROCESS:

1. Understand the Problem Deeply
   - Read everything carefully - what are the inputs, outputs, constraints?
   - What exactly needs to be computed or created?
   - Study any examples - what patterns emerge?
   - What edge cases exist?
   - What is this problem really testing?

2. Design Your Approach
   - What strategy would work for THIS specific problem?
   - What techniques or data structures fit?
   - Can I break this into smaller parts?
   - What's my high-level plan?

3. Verify Logic BEFORE Implementation
   CRITICAL: Test your reasoning mentally first
   - Take the simplest example from the problem
   - Walk through your approach step-by-step in your mind
   - Does each step logically produce the next?
   - Do you arrive at the correct answer?
   - Where might your logic fail?
   - Are you handling all requirements?

4. Build the Solution
   - Implement your verified approach
   - Address each requirement from the problem
   - Use appropriate syntax/format for expected output type
   - Keep constraints in mind

5. Validate Your Work
   - Pick an example from the problem
   - Trace through YOUR solution step-by-step
   - Track values at each stage
   - Does final output match expected result?
   - If NO: which exact step went wrong? Fix it
   - Test with another example if available

6. Check Edge Cases
   - Boundary conditions (min/max values, empty inputs)
   - Special cases from constraints
   - Scenarios where logic might break

FINAL REALITY CHECK before outputting:
□ Have I solved the SPECIFIC problem given?
□ Does my output contain the actual solution/deliverable?
□ Am I about to output instructions instead of a solution?
□ Does my output match the required format?

If you're outputting guidance or meta-analysis → STOP and actually solve the problem

Remember: Output the SOLUTION to the problem, not a discussion about solving
