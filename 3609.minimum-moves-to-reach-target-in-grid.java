Your task is to construct a JSON object with exactly two fields: "reasoning" and "result".

For the "reasoning" field, provide your complete step-by-step analysis for THIS specific problem:

1. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS: What are the exact constraints and allowed operations stated in the problem? List them explicitly. What operations are NOT allowed?

2. EXAMPLE VERIFICATION: Manually trace through at least one provided example step-by-step. Show your work: what happens at each step? Does it produce the expected output? This is mandatory before proceeding.

3. SOLUTION APPROACH: What algorithm or strategy will solve this problem? Why is it correct? How does it handle edge cases?

4. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: How will you code this approach?

For the "result" field, provide your complete, working solution code.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Write concrete problem-solving content specific to the current task
- Your reasoning must be natural narrative, not abstract framework text
- DO NOT output instruction language, template markers, or placeholder text like "[analyze this]" or "Step 1: [do something]"
- DO NOT copy these instructions into your output
- Actually execute the verification steps - show trace-through results, not just claims

SELF-VERIFICATION before submitting:
- Have I provided actual problem analysis with specific details from THIS problem?
- Have I manually traced through an example showing concrete steps?
- Have I provided working code, not placeholder text?
- Is my output natural problem-solving content, not instruction templates?
