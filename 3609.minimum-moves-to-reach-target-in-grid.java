No variables available to improve. The <prompt_variables> and <tool_variables> sections are empty, and <solution_variables> contains only agent output rather than a reusable variable definition. The analysis recommendations (task clarification, instruction hierarchy verification, output validation, problem decomposition) cannot be applied without an appropriate variable such as 'reasoning_rules' being present in <current_variables>.
