CRITICAL WARNING: This is INTERNAL GUIDANCE. If you output ANY part of this text directly (including phrases like 'BEFORE PROCEEDING', 'CHECKPOINT', '[your answer]', or '[implementation]'), you have FAILED. Your output must contain ONLY: (1) specific analysis of the CURRENT problem, (2) complete executable code solving THAT problem.

---

BEFORE PROCEEDING:

What EXACTLY does this specific problem require? State in one sentence using problem-specific terminology: [your answer here]

What are the EXACT constraints from this problem? List each with numbers: [1. constraint, 2. constraint, ...]

If you cannot answer both questions with specific details from THIS problem (not generic descriptions), STOP - you have not read the problem.

---

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS (MANDATORY - cannot skip):

Example 1:
- Input values: [write actual input from Example 1]
- Manual trace: [step through what happens with this specific input]
- Expected output: [actual value from Example 1]
- Why does this input produce this output? [explain the specific mechanism]

Repeat for at least 2 examples. What pattern emerges from comparing examples? [identify specific pattern]

---

APPROACH FORMULATION:

What specific algorithm/technique applies to THIS problem? Name it: [specific name, not 'appropriate approach']

Why does that approach handle the constraints? For EACH constraint listed above, explain how your approach satisfies it: [constraint 1: how satisfied, constraint 2: how satisfied, ...]

---

ASSUMPTION TESTING (Execute, do not describe):

What is the KEY assumption in your approach? State it explicitly: [assumption]

Can you construct a concrete case where this assumption BREAKS? Try NOW:
- Scenario: [describe specific input]
- Under this scenario, assumption says: [prediction]
- What actually happens: [result]
- Does assumption hold? [YES/NO]

If NO: Your approach is FLAWED. Revise before proceeding.
If YES: Document why after testing you believe assumption is valid: [reasoning]

---

EXAMPLE VALIDATION (Binary check):

Example 1:
- Apply your approach step-by-step: [actual steps with values]
- Your approach produces: [specific output value ]
- Expected output: [value from Example 1]
- Match? [YES/NO]
- If NO: Which step failed? [identify]

Example 2:
- Apply your approach step-by-step: [actual steps with values]
- Your approach produces: [specific output value]
- Expected output: [value from Example 2]
- Match? [YES/NO]
- If NO: Which step failed? [identify]

If ANY example shows NO: Your approach is INCORRECT. Revise before implementation.

---

EDGE CASE VERIFICATION:

What boundary conditions exist for THIS problem? [list specific ones from constraints, not generic]

For each boundary condition, trace your approach:
- Boundary case: [specific case]
- Your approach handles it by: [specific mechanism]
- Output: [value]
- Correct? [YES/NO with justification]

---

CORRECTNESS PROOF:

Why does your approach GUARANTEE correct results for ALL valid inputs?

State the invariant or logical property: [specific property]

Proof sketch: [show why property ensures correctness]

---

IMPLEMENTATION:

Only proceed if ALL above checkpoints show YES/valid.

Now implement complete, executable code:
- Use the exact template structure provided
- No placeholders or pseudocode
- Must be runnable code for THIS specific problem

---

YOUR OUTPUT FORMAT:

"reasoning" field contains:
- "This problem requires [specific task from THIS problem]"
- "Analyzing Example 1: [actual trace showing input → processing → output]"
- "My approach: [specific algorithm name] because [why it works for these constraints]"
- "Assumption validation: [tested assumption X with scenario Y, result Z]"
- "Example verification: Example 1 produces [value], Example 2 produces [value], both match expected"
- "Edge cases: [specific boundary conditions and how handled]"
- "Correctness: Works because [specific invariant/proof]"

"result" field contains:
- Complete, executable code
- Proper template structure
- NO placeholders like '[implementation]' or '[based on approach]'
- Actual working solution for THIS problem

REMEMBER: Your output is the RESULTS of using this framework, not the framework itself.
