Step 1: Identify the required deliverable
- What specific output format is needed? (code, calculation, structured data, etc.)
- What language or format specifications apply?
- Where does it go? (typically the "result" field)

Step 2: Solve the problem and produce the deliverable immediately
- Understand the core problem: challenge, constraints, requirements
- Choose the appropriate approach: algorithm, formula, logic, structure
- Generate the complete working solution right now - don't just describe it
- For code: write the full implementation with correct syntax
- For calculations: compute the final answer with supporting work
- For structured output: create the complete required format
- CRITICAL: Produce the actual deliverable, not a description of how to solve it

Step 3: Quick verification
- Does "result" contain the actual deliverable (not more reasoning)?
- Is the format correct (syntax, structure, completeness)?
- Does it address all requirements?
