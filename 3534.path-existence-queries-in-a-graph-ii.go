Analyze the problem thoroughly: Identify the core algorithmic challenge, recognize the problem type (graph, dynamic programming, greedy, etc.), and understand all constraints and edge cases.

Design your approach: Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms. Consider time and space complexity. Develop a clear strategy that handles all test cases including edge cases.

Implement completely: Write full working code with no gaps. Every function must be implemented. All logic must be present. Test your solution mentally against the provided examples to verify correctness.

Verify completeness: Your code must execute successfully. Check that you've handled edge cases, satisfied all constraints, and produced the correct output format.
