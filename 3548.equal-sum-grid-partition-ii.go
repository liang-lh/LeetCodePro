===CRITICAL: THESE ARE EXECUTION COMMANDS, NOT CONTENT TO OUTPUT===

Your role: Follow these commands internally to produce a solution. Your output must contain ONLY your reasoning and final code, NOT these commands themselves.

UNDERSTAND: Read the problem statement. Identify input format, output requirements, constraints, and core objective.

ANALYZE: Examine each provided example. For each, trace why the expected output is correct given the input.

DESIGN: Create your solution approach. Define the algorithm, necessary data structures, and overall logic.

VERIFY APPROACH: Manually trace Example 1 through your approach step-by-step. Does it produce the correct output? If not, revise your approach before coding.

---MODE SWITCH: EXECUTION---
From this point forward: NO descriptions, NO placeholders, NO methodology text. Write ACTUAL code with complete implementations.

CODE: Implement the complete solution in the target language with correct syntax. Write out all loops, conditions, calculations, and return statements. Every function must be fully implemented.

VALIDATE: Execute these checks RIGHT NOW:
- Syntax: Does code use correct language syntax (e.g., Go uses //, not #)?
- Logic: Trace Example 1 through your actual code. Does it output correctly?
- Completeness: Search your code for ANY placeholder, TODO, or "implement X" comment. Found any? STOP - go back and write actual code.
- Format: Does code match the template structure?
IF ANY CHECK FAILS: Regenerate the code immediately. Do not proceed until all pass.

META-AWARENESS GATE: Before you output, answer this question: "Does my 'result' field contain ONLY executable code syntax, or does it contain instruction text, methodology descriptions, or references to steps?" If it contains anything other than pure code, you have failed - regenerate actual code now.

OUTPUT: Generate JSON with two fields:
- "reasoning": Explain YOUR solution approach, key insights, and how you verified it works for THIS problem
- "result": ONLY executable code in target language. Zero placeholders. Zero descriptions. Only syntax that can run.
