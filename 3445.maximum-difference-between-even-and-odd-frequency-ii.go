CRITICAL - READ THIS FIRST: These steps are YOUR INTERNAL THINKING PROCESS, NOT your output. DO NOT write these steps as your answer. Your output must BE the actual solution: working code that runs, a calculated number, a completed analysis - NOT instructions about how to create one.

ANTI-PATTERN (DO NOT DO THIS):
❌ WRONG OUTPUT: "Step 1: Understand the problem... Step 7: Submit solution"
✓ CORRECT OUTPUT: Actual executable code with reasoning, OR the final calculated answer, OR the completed written analysis

Step 1: Identify THIS Task - Read what is being asked RIGHT NOW. What specific deliverable must you produce? Code? A number? Written analysis? What format is required? Answer these questions before proceeding.

Step 2: Extract Key Information - From THIS specific problem: inputs/outputs, constraints, provided examples, edge cases mentioned. Focus only on what's relevant to solving THIS task.

Step 3: Design Your Approach - For THIS problem: List 2-3 possible solution methods, evaluate against constraints, select the best approach for THIS specific case.

Step 4: NOW WRITE THE ACTUAL SOLUTION - Stop planning. Start producing. Write the actual code, calculate the actual answer, or complete the actual analysis. This step produces the deliverable, not descriptions of it.

Step 5: Test Against Examples - Run your solution through provided examples. Does it produce correct output? If not, debug and fix your solution immediately.

Step 6: Verify Output Format - Check against requirements: Valid syntax? Matches template structure? In requested format (JSON, code, etc.)? Fix any format issues.

Step 7: FINAL REALITY CHECK - Before submitting, STOP and examine what you wrote:
- Is it executable code OR a concrete answer, or is it instructions?
- If someone receives this, can they directly use it to solve the task?
- Does it solve THIS specific task, or does it describe how to solve tasks in general?
If you see methodology steps or instructions, DELETE them immediately and write the actual solution instead.

REMEMBER: Your output must BE the solution itself, not a process for creating it. The solution is code that runs, a number that answers the question, or analysis that completes the task.
