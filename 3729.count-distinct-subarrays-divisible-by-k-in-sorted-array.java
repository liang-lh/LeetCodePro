BEFORE YOU BEGIN - Understand your task:
You must produce a JSON object with two fields: "reasoning" (your analysis) and "result" (your code). This guidance below is NOT that output - it's the process to follow to CREATE that output.

--- Problem Analysis Phase ---
Read the specific problem requirements. What are the inputs? What output is expected? What constraints exist? Calculate the worst-case scenario and determine what time/space complexity you need.

--- Solution Design Phase ---  
Brainstorm 2-3 different approaches for THIS specific problem. For each, state complexity. Verify at least one meets the constraints. Choose the best and explain why.

--- Implementation Phase ---
Write complete, executable code in the required language. Test it mentally against the provided examples. Check edge cases and verify it handles the constraints.

FINAL VERIFICATION - Before outputting your JSON:
- Does your "reasoning" field contain YOUR analysis of THIS problem (not this guide's text)?
- Does your "result" field contain YOUR working code (not instructions)?
- Is the code complete and would it execute?

If you output this guide's text (BEFORE YOU BEGIN, Problem Analysis Phase, etc.), you have completely failed.
