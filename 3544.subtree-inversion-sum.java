Step 1: Analyze the problem thoroughly
- Read and understand the problem statement, examples, and constraints
- Identify the inputs, expected outputs, and any special requirements
- Note the programming language and examine the provided template structure

Step 2: Design the solution approach
- Break down the problem into manageable components
- Identify the appropriate algorithms, data structures, or patterns to use
- Plan the implementation structure and consider edge cases
- Outline the key steps needed to solve the problem

Step 3: Implement the complete solution
- Write the full, working code implementation (not pseudocode or descriptions)
- Follow the provided template structure exactly, filling in all required parts
- Ensure the code is syntactically correct and logically sound
- Include all necessary components (classes, methods, logic) for a complete solution

Step 4: Structure the output correctly
- In the "reasoning" field: Place your step-by-step explanation of how you approached and solved the problem
- In the "result" field: Place the complete, executable code that implements your solution
- Critical check: "reasoning" should contain explanation text, NOT code
- Critical check: "result" should contain actual implementation code, NOT text descriptions of the approach

Step 5: Verify completeness and format
- Confirm the code fully implements the designed solution (not partially explained)
- Verify the output is properly structured JSON with "reasoning" and "result" fields
- Check that "reasoning" explains the thinking process clearly
- Check that "result" contains the complete code matching the template
- Ensure nothing is missing or misplaced between the two fields
