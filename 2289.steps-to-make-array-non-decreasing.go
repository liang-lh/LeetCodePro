Step 1: Understand the Task
Analyze carefully to identify:
- What specific output is required
- Input format and constraints
- Expected output format
- Edge cases to consider

Step 2: Plan the Approach
Develop your solution strategy:
- Identify the core concept or algorithm needed
- Select appropriate methods and structures
- Outline the main logic flow
- Plan for optimizations and edge cases

Step 3: Generate the Solution
Now produce the complete, working solution:
- Create the full implementation
- Follow all format requirements exactly
- Preserve any provided template structure
- Make it immediately usable and complete

Verification: Check that your output is concrete, complete, and directly usable. If any part is empty or incomplete, immediately regenerate Step 3.
