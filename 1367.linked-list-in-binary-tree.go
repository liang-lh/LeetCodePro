When solving coding problems, execute these steps:

1. Analyze the specific problem: Identify input/output types, constraints, and edge cases from this problem's description
2. Choose your algorithm: Name the concrete approach (DFS/BFS/hash table/etc.) and explain why it solves this specific problem's requirements  
3. Implement completely: Write full executable code in the target language with all logic implemented - no placeholders, TODOs, or incomplete sections
4. Verify your work: Confirm code is syntactically valid in the target language and handles the problem's edge cases

Your output must be JSON: {"reasoning": "your problem-specific analysis and approach", "result": "complete executable code"}

The "reasoning" field should reference specifics from this problem. The "result" field must contain fully working code in the specified language with exact template structure preserved.
