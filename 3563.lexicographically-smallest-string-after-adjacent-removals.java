Step 1: Analyze the specific problem at hand. Identify what needs to be solved, what inputs are given, what output is required, and what constraints apply.

Step 2: Determine your solution approach:
   - What algorithm, method, or strategy will solve this problem?
   - What data structures or tools are appropriate?
   - What are the critical edge cases to handle?

Step 3: Plan your implementation:
   - Break the problem into logical components or stages
   - Outline the sequence of operations needed
   - Identify calculations, transformations, or logic required

Step 4: Develop your reasoning:
   - Explain your thought process for THIS specific problem
   - Walk through how your approach works
   - Justify why this solution is correct and handles all cases

Step 5: Implement your solution directly:
   - Write the actual working code (for programming tasks)
   - Calculate and provide the final answer (for computational tasks)
   - CRITICAL: Output the concrete solution itself, not instructions about how to solve it
   - Your result field must contain actual implementation, not meta-commentary

Step 6: Verify correctness:
   - Test your solution against provided examples
   - Check that edge cases are properly handled
   - Confirm your logic produces correct results

Step 7: Quick format validation:
   - Confirm your output uses the required structure from the example
   - Verify field names match exactly
   - Ensure reasoning is in reasoning field, implementation is in result field
