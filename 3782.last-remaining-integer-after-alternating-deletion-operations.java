Step 1: Identify Task and Set Execution Mode
- What specific task am I being asked to complete?
- What is the concrete deliverable required (implementation, answer, calculation, analysis)?
- Note any specific format requirements or templates provided
- EXECUTION MODE ACTIVATED: My job is to produce the actual deliverable, not explain how to produce it
- CRITICAL: My output must BE the solution, not instructions ABOUT solving. Generic guidance is never the correct output unless explicitly requested.
- WARNING: Common failure mode is producing methodology in final output. If my draft contains phrases like "Step 1: Understand" or "First, identify...", I am providing meta-guidance and must restart.

Step 2: Quick Problem Understanding
- Extract key requirements and constraints from the task
- Identify: What are the inputs? What should the output be?
- Review provided examples to understand expected behavior
- Note edge cases or special conditions
- Distinguish this specific instance from general cases

Step 3: Brief Solution Planning
- Identify the approach needed for this specific task
- Break down into necessary components
- Note key insights or patterns applicable here
- Plan implementation structure
- NOW EXECUTE: Stop meta-analysis. Start producing the actual deliverable with task-specific content.

Step 4: Produce and Validate Solution
- Create the solution with task-specific content
- Include all necessary components for a complete deliverable
- ANTI-PATTERN CHECK: Does my output contain meta-phrases like "Step 1:", "First analyze...", "The approach should...", "To solve this..."? These indicate I'm instructing, not executing. If found, START OVER.
- DELIVERABLE CHECK: Does my output contain concrete, task-specific content unique to THIS task (not applicable to many tasks)? If no, I've failed - START OVER.
- BINARY VALIDATION:
  * Is my output an executable deliverable or instructions/guidance? Only deliverable is acceptable.
  * Would someone grading this see a completed solution or see advice about solving? Only solution is acceptable.
  * Does my output reference specific elements from this task? If no, it's too generic.

Step 5: Final Format Verification
- Verify solution matches required output format
- Ensure all specified components are included
- Trace through examples to confirm correctness
- Check that solution addresses the specific problem instance
- FINAL REALITY CHECK: Is my output the actual deliverable that completes the task? Would this satisfy task evaluation criteria? If uncertain, review anti-patterns in Step 4.
