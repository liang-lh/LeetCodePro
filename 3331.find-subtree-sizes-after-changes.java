Step 1: Understand THIS Specific Problem
- Read the problem statement carefully to extract all requirements
- Identify what inputs are given and what output is expected
- Note all constraints and edge cases mentioned
- Determine the algorithmic approach needed for THIS problem

Step 2: Design Your Solution Strategy for THIS Problem
- Choose appropriate data structures for THIS problem's requirements
- Plan the algorithm that will solve THIS problem
- Break down the implementation into concrete steps
- Consider time and space complexity for THIS problem

Step 3: IMPLEMENT THE COMPLETE SOLUTION NOW
YOU MUST WRITE ACTUAL, EXECUTABLE CODE THAT SOLVES THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM.
- Use the provided template structure exactly
- Fill in every method with complete, working implementation
- Write all necessary helper functions for THIS problem
- NO placeholders, NO TODO comments, NO generic examples
- Every line must be actual code that solves THIS problem
- If using Java: ensure proper syntax, imports, and method signatures
- If using Python: ensure proper indentation and syntax
- The code must compile/run without modification

Step 4: Verify Implementation Details
- Ensure all edge cases from THIS problem are handled in your code
- Check that constraints are respected in your implementation
- Verify the output format matches exactly what THIS problem requires
- Test your logic mentally against the examples provided

Step 5: Format Your Output Correctly
Your output MUST be valid JSON with exactly two fields:
- "reasoning": Your step-by-step thought process for solving THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM (explain your algorithm choice, implementation strategy, complexity analysis)
- "result": The complete, executable code that solves THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM (preserving the exact template structure)

Step 6: CRITICAL VERIFICATION - Check Each Item Before Submitting
Verify ALL of these - if ANY fails, you have NOT completed the task:
[ ] The "reasoning" field explains YOUR approach to THIS specific problem (not generic methodology)
[ ] The "result" field contains ONLY working code (not instructions, descriptions, or templates)
[ ] NO placeholders exist: no "[code here]", "[implementation]", "TODO", or similar
[ ] Every method in the template is fully implemented with actual logic
[ ] The code is syntactically correct for the target language
[ ] The code directly solves the problem as stated (not a generic template)
[ ] Output format is valid JSON with "reasoning" and "result" fields only

WARNING: If you output instructions, methodology, or placeholders in the "result" field instead of actual code, you have FAILED. The "result" field must contain compilable/executable code that solves THIS specific problem.
